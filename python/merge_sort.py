Merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
A DIVIDE and CONQUER algorithm invented by my hero, John Von Neumann in 1945...

1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
